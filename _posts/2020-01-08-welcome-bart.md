This summer I joined the [GloBAM team](/team/) as post-doctoral researcher at the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics](https://ibed.uva.nl/) of the University of Amsterdam. Here I will investigate how the environment influences the migration of birds using weather radar. 

I am a movement ecologist interested in the distributions and movements of animals and how these are influenced by the environment. To investigate this I use and develop computational tools, for example the R package ["move"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/move/index.html). During my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology I have both investigated bird migrations and developed models for space use. Before starting in Amsterdam I have investigated the movements of meerkats at the University of Zurich. Most of my work has focused on individually tracked animals. Now I am excited by the possibilities of using weather radar to investigate movements across the airspace.
