Our fundamental objectives are to blbla

## Urban Data Science

Urban data science explains urban systems and phenomena with micro-level data.

_(a) Industry structure of the largest US cities [(Sci. Adv., 2020)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/34/eaba4934), 
(b) Human mobility network in five Korean cities [(Physica A, 2016)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116303235), and 
(c) Happiness and urban green space measured by satellite imagery [(EPJ DS, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00278-7)._

## Bibliographic Analysis

Bibliographic analysis allows explorations of knowledge.

_Average intensities of bird migration, inferred from weather radar data, across a) Europe over 3 weeks in autumn 2016 (from [Nilsson et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04003)), and b) during spring across the US between 1995-2017 (from [Horton et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2029))._

## Network Science

Network science describes real-world phenomena with underlying interactions.
