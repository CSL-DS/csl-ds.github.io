Our fundamental objectives are to blbla

## Urban Data Science

Urban data science explains urban systems and phenomena with micro-level data.

_We aim to use weather radars to monitor the movements of aerial migrants such as a) birds (image by Barth Bailey/Unsplash.com) and b) insects (image by aaabbbccc/Shutterstock.com)._

## Bibliographic Analysis

Bibliographic analysis allows explorations of knowledge.

_Average intensities of bird migration, inferred from weather radar data, across a) Europe over 3 weeks in autumn 2016 (from [Nilsson et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04003)), and b) during spring across the US between 1995-2017 (from [Horton et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2029))._

## Network Science

Network science describes real-world phenomena with underlying interactions.
