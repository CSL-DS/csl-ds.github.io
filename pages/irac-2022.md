We cordially invite you to the **3rd International Radar Aeroecology Conference (IRAC 2022)** in Davos, Switzerland. The conference takes place on 25-26 June 2022, directly before the [World Biodiversity Forum](https://www.worldbiodiversityforum.org/). We look forward to welcoming many of you in person in Davos, but we will also offer online participation and make special arrangements for online participants presenting from different time zones. The conference will be a full 2-day event with plenary presentations, a poster session, and possibilities for informal discussions and networking.
