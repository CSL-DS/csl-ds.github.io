#### Aloft and On the Ground: Do Bird Radar data and Constant Effort Bird Ringing Data of Migrants in Eilat, Israel, correlate?

**Tsafra Evra**, Inbal Schekler, Noam Weiss, David Troupin, Nir Sapir

Israel lies at a bottleneck along one of the world’s most important migration flyways. Thanks to that, during migration season many birds can be seen around the country, both in the sky and on the ground. Monitoring of migrating birds is done in various methods, with constant effort trapping and bird radar surveillance being amongst them. The International Birding and Research Center in Eilat (IBRCE) is one of the birding centers in Israel that partakes in a constant effort trapping and ringing of birds over the last 8 years.  Yet, it is unknown whether bird densities trapped on the ground correspond to the densities of actively migrating birds aloft. For exploring and measuring aerial bird densities we used data from a Birdscan MR-1 bird radar (Swiss-birdradar. Winterthur, Switzerland) and examined if there is a correlation between radar data in the form of Migration Traffic Rates (MTR) of nocturnally migrating birds in the area, and the number of birds trapped in the IBRCE. To answer this question, we used the constant effort ringing data from the migration seasons of 2016 (February-May and August-November) and compared it to data from the Birdscan-MR-1 radar that was positioned 3 km NNE of the IBRCE in 2016. Our preliminary findings show a positive correlation between the mean MTR of birds during the night and the number of birds trapped in IBRCE in the following day, but only during the fall migration season and not during spring, indicating a season-specific relationships between aloft and on-ground bird densities.

#### Combining radio-telemetry and radar measurements to reveal how insect abundance affects the movements of an aerial insectivore

**[Itai Bloch](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7514-2121)**, David Troupin, Sivan Toledo, Ran Nathan, Nir Sapir

The movement properties of foraging animals are known to vary in relation to prey abundance, as described for terrestrial and marine environments. Yet, due to technological and logistical limitations, there is still lack of information regarding the foraging movements of aerial foragers. Specifically for insectivores, it is well established that insect abundance aloft is highly variable over time but it is not clear if and in what ways aerial insect predators respond to these dynamics. We used BirdScan-MR1 radar to estimate the Movement Traffic Rate (MTR) of insects over the Hula Valley in northeastern Israel and used tiny transmitters of the ATLAS system attached to Little swifts (*Apus affinis*) to investigate specific foraging movement properties. The unique combination of these two advanced systems allowed examining, for the first time, how the dynamics of insect densities affect the movement of aerial insectivores. We examined how insect MTR affected eight different movement properties of Little swifts during the breeding season. We found that insect MTR varied between different days by up to one order of magnitude. We found a decrease in the mean distance of the birds from the breeding colony but an increase in the length of daily foraging trajectory in days with higher insect MTR. Also in days with higher insect MTR, the rate of visits to the colony was lower and the arrival at the breeding colony at dusk was earlier. Additionally, the distance between individuals increased with higher insect MTR. We found no effect of insect MTR on the time of morning departure from the breeding colony, the flight speed of the birds, and the duration of visits at the breeding colony. The study shows that variation in the abundance of aerial insects influence key foraging movement properties, with possible impact on the breeding characteristics and potentially the reproductive output of swifts. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of studies that combine radar and biotelemetry methodologies for enhanced understanding of different ecological processes by providing a thorough exploration of predator-prey relationships in the airspace.

#### Between sea and desert: soaring migrants beneficially modulate their flight in relation to sea-breeze

Environmental conditions influence the density and movement of flying migrants at different spatiotemporal scales. Soaring land migrants are often funnelling in so-called migratory bottlenecks and corridors, which are characterized by geographic features that allow them to minimize their cost of transport, compared to nearby areas. When flying over a migratory corridor, birds are still at the mercy of the weather conditions and could be subjected to adverse winds that may increase their flight energetics, slow them down or even terminate their flight. Millions of migrating soaring birds funnel between the sea and the desert twice a year along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant region. Especially during autumn migration, the birds encounter westerly winds due to the daily sea-breeze circulation. We were interested to understand how migrating soaring birds cope and/or exploit a changing lateral wind flow (sea-breeze) during their southward journey parallel to the coastline. We used automatically measured diurnal bird tracks recorded by the MRL-5 weather radar dedicated to bird tracking, which is located at Latrun in central Israel (34.98N, 31.84E) during eight different years between 2005 and 2016. Our results show the diurnal sea-breeze development, confirming that low-speed westerly wind increased in speed during the afternoon, as well as a clockwise rotation of wind direction from 90 to 135 degrees. This resulted in a constant increase of wind support (from 0 to 3 m/s) and a more variable eastward crosswind with increasing speed between morning to early afternoon, followed by a rather stable maximum speed for 1-2 hours and decreasing speed before sunset. Notably, birds decreased their airspeed throughout the day and modulated sideways speed by increasing it towards the direction of the wind as the crosswind speed increased, and decreasing it when crosswind speed decreased, allowing a relatively stable groundspeed and flying direction throughout the migration day. Our work highlights the flexible flight behaviour of soaring migrants, thereby enhancing the understanding of the movement ecology of soaring migrants, as well as its practical aspects, including bird-aircraft collision risks.

#### Assessing the impact of fireworks on urban birds using L-Band staring radar

**[Joseph Wayman](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3122-8070)**, George Atkinson, M. Jahangir, M. Antoniou, J. Reynolds, J. Sadler

Fireworks and other pyrotechnics have long been known as a source of disturbance for wildlife, highlighted by the fact that they, accompanied by their loud noises at discharge, are often used as wildlife deterrents. Consequently, events that utilise fireworks have the potential to impact local wildlife detrimentally and it is, therefore, important to investigate how fireworks affect local animal populations. Here we provide an initial exploration of the effect of fireworks on urban birds using an L-band staring radar as a tool to capture and characterise bird flight tracks within the city of Birmingham, UK. The radar covered a 90-degree sector out to a 5km range, from ground height to a 900m altitude. To examine how flighted behaviour changed during evenings/nights of excessive firework use in the area, we compared quantitatively the number, speed, and height of birds aloft during the same period in the days preceding and after New Year’s Eve (i.e., 28/12/2021 – 02/12/2022) and New Year’s Eve night (when fireworks were let off in large numbers at midnight and directly after). There were significantly more tracks in the period directly after midnight than in the same period on preceding and subsequent evening (389 compared to 20 and 25 respectively), observable as a peak in the number of targets aloft. Birds during this period of disruption flew higher than in the same period on preceding and subsequent evenings, but they did not fly for longer. Radar data indicated that birds flew at higher elevations and in greater numbers during times when they were subjected to intense disturbance from firework usage, at a point in their diurnal cycle when many would otherwise be roosting. This energy expenditure may have implications for avian fitness and survival, especially during the winter months when fireworks are typically set off and daily energy expenditure of birds is higher due to elevated thermoregulatory costs. Further work and long-term monitoring looking at which species are most impacted by such forms of disturbance are vital to identify mitigations such as more intense regulation of fireworks in urban spaces. 


#### The impact of hydrometeors on bird migration as observed by various remote sensing systems

Meteorological conditions are a key modulator of bird migration dynamics. Besides wind, precipitation is considered a decisive antagonist to bird migration intensity. However, the role of precipitation might not be so straightforward and its detriment to migrants could be also conditioned by different degrees of visibility in precipitative conditions at various altitude layers. For example, spatial analysis of classified polarimetric weather radar observations in rain situations show that bird migration is present all around a precipitation area. Rain and bird echoes even coalesce, and birds may continue also below the clouds and thus in the rain. Besides, ceilometer measurements prove that low-level Stratus clouds with poor visibility are often present below the precipitating clouds. However, there is no research that has actually looked at bird migration during precipitative conditions in altitude and in relation to the visibility in precipitation. Also, the role of precipitation in migration studies is typically deduced from ground-based rain gauges, often with a coarse temporal resolution and ignoring conditions in altitude and time. The reason for that is obviously the failure of monitoring devices in precipitative circumstances, e.g. in most radars, bird signals are masked by rain and drizzle, and thus aeroecologists’ only mass migration study tool is rendered futile. However, time series data of low-frequency radar wind profilers depict bird echoes even in different kinds of precipitation. So, this provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of various types of hydrometeors on migration dynamics in combination with other meteorological data from complementary remote sensing systems. Here we present preliminary findings of bird migration in different types of precipitative and cloud conditions as observed by radar wind profiler, ceilometer and rain gauges from two migration seasons.

#### Dealiasing of radial velocities based on interleaved dual-PRF measurements and bin-based polarimetric echo classification

**[Nadja Weisshaupt](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4510-4121)**, Jarmo Koistinen

Weather radars provide amongst others measurements of radial velocities of targets. Radial velocities are reliable as long as a certain target type does not exceed the maximum unambiguous velocity, so-called Nyquist velocity, determined for a given pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Velocities of targets exceeding this limit are folded and require corrective dealiasing. Many dealiasing approaches have been developed which work well for wide-spread targets with uniform direction and speed, such as rain or insects (passive wind tracers). However, in many operational sweeps with low PRF these methods do not work well for birds with spatially heterogenous directions and speeds. Also, interference between mixed target types may affect the outcome of dealiasing, e.g. insect or rain contamination in a bird sample. Bin-based polarimetric target classification can help reduce the risk of mixed velocities from different target classes in one volume, though it does not avoid mosaic aliased velocity patterns or the Nyquist dilemma. On the other hand, non-polarimetric interleaved dual-PRF sweeps will give much better velocity estimates although they lack polarimetric information. Here we propose a novel method using a combination of interleaved elevation sweeps of bin-based polarimetric classification and dual-PRF measurements to circumvent dealiasing during bird migration and to obtain radial velocities for the calculation of migration traffic rates.

#### Bird Migration Forecast : Developing Radar-Based Forecasts of Bird Migration over Switzerland

**Tom Carrard**, Baptiste Schmid, Lukas Gudmundsson

Bird migration represents a massive flow of biomass that takes place twice a year between their breeding and non-breeding ground. The development of human infrastructure has led to increased conflicts in the aerial space. Artificial lights, high buildings, communication towers, and other infrastructures are thought to be responsible for an increased mortality during bird migratory flights. On the other hand, bird strike represents a source of danger and leads to economic loss. Forecasting mass movements of migratory birds can mitigate these negative interactions in the aerial space.
Existing forecasting systems combine weather radar measurements of migration intensity with meteorological data. This master thesis project aims to develop a forecasting system for nocturnal bird migration intensity for the Swiss Lowland using six years of dedicated small-scale radar monitoring (BirdScan MR1) in Sempach, Switzerland. Statistical models will be trained on migratory traffic rates in combination with meteorological data from ERA-5 reanalysis. The best performing model will be used to develop and display a real-time migration forecast using weather forecasts from ECMWF.

#### RADAR in a multisensory setup: a case study to assess the impact of an aerial deterrent

**[Yuval Werber](https://orcid.org// 0000-0002-9858-1872)**, Gadi Hareli, Omer Yinon, Nir Sapir, Yossi Yovel

Remote sensing technologies operate within a certain scale at a given accuracy, preventing comprehensive data collection of animal aeroecology. To overcome this problem, we adopted a multi-sensor approach by uniquely combining RADAR, LIDAR and ultrasonic recording to test a novel technology for reducing bat mortality from wind turbine blades. Wind energy, a rapidly growing industry, induces mortality of flying animals and bats in particular. We tested an airborne deterrent which produces a pulsating combination of strong auditory and visual signals. The device was flown at an altitude of 100 m, to examine its impact at heights that are typical of many wind farm facilities. We used LIDAR to assess the device’s impact at altitudes below the deterrent height, corresponding to turbine nacelle altitudes, while RADAR assessed its influence at heights above 100 m, higher than turbine nacelle. Ground level and high altitude automated ultrasonic acoustic recorders carried by an aerostat were used to describe bat activity in the research site during the experiment up to 500 m AGL.
We recorded intense activity of multiple bat species throughout the experiment, revealing altitudinal and hourly activity trends and substantiating the intense use of bats, but not birds, of the site during the experiment. We revealed a significant ~40% decrease in activity below, and a significant increase above the deterrent’s flight altitude during the device’s operation compared to controls, implying that when exposed to the deterrent, bats avoided it by increasing flight altitude. We concluded that the deterrent proved highly efficient in reducing bat activity in a designated airspace. Interestingly, the sole use of LIDAR or RADAR for monitoring the effects of the device would have produced conflicting results, failed to disclose the actual pattern, and could critically bias our results and conclusions. Our work exemplifies the importance of undertaking comprehensive studies which are rarely feasible using a single sensor. We suggest that stationary RADAR operation sites can act as large scale “aerial field laboratories” where other technologies can be deployed to complement detection capabilities towards specific aims or during routine operation.

#### Distinguishing birds from waves based on radar track characteristics

**Jacco Leemans**, Camiel Heunks, Abel Gyimesi, Jonne Kleyheeg-Hartman

Direct measurements on avian collision mortality in wind farms located offshore or in inland waters is challenging. Namely, fatality searches are not possible as victims fall in the water and sink. Therefore, currently collision risk models are commonly used to predict the number of casualties in these wind farms. The outcomes of these models are known to be sensitive to assumptions made about the behavior of the species concerned. However, data on avoidance behavior, fluxes, flight speeds and flight altitudes are scarce and could be highly location specific. Such data can be collected by specialized bird radars. These radars are capable of simultaneously tracking multiple birds in a relatively large area during large periods of time, including nighttime. However, in aquatic environments even the most advanced bird radars have difficulties in filtering out radar echoes caused by waves, which can substantially reduce the quality of the collected radar data and thus its usability. In 2021, a full 3D Max® bird radar was installed to monitor the effects of a large wind farm located in the IJsselmeer, the largest lake in the Netherlands with a surface area of 1133 km². This type of bird radar automatically collects and stores a large amount of characteristics of every track within its reach. During field visits, observers have identified the source of radar tracks, including birds and waves. The analysis of these tagged radar tracks indicates that waves can be distinguished from birds based on a combination of several radar track characteristics, like radar cross-section, track quality, track length, directionality, and altitude. Based on the first results of a model that classifies tracks based on these characteristics, we expect that more than 90% of waves can be filtered out. Such model could therefore considerably improve the quality of the collected data. Moreover, this opens up opportunities for (improved) real-time classification of waves, which could significantly increase the effectiveness of mitigation measures like radar assisted shutdown on-demand of wind turbines in periods with high bird activity.

#### Climatic drivers of Bracken Cave (USA) bat migration phenology and demography

**[Birgen Haest](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8739-6460)**, Jennifer J. Krauel, Silke Bauer, Felix Liechti, Charlotte Wainwright, Phillip Stepanian

Changes in the timing of seasonal migrations have been observed across biological taxa, including birds, mammals, and insects. For birds, strong links have been shown between changes in migration phenology and changes in weather conditions at the wintering, stopover, and breeding areas. For other animal taxa, the current understanding of influences of climate change on migration timing remains limited. Many migratory animal populations also show strong changes in population sizes over the last decades, but in most cases the exact role of climate change remains to be teased apart from other driving factors. For many taxa, such as insects and bats, a major obstacle in furthering our understanding of how climate change affects both phenology and demography is the lack of long-term phenology datasets. 
Bracken Cave in Texas (USA) holds one of the largest bat colonies of the world. Using weather radar data, a unique 23-year (1995–2017) long time series was recently produced of the nightly population estimates of Brazilian free-tailed bats (_Tadarida brasiliensis_) at Bracken Cave. Here, we use this dataset in combination with gridded weather data across North America to identify the combinations of weather variables, locations, and time periods that likely drive changes in the seasonal (1) migration phenology and (2) demography at Bracken Cave. We found spring migration phenology to be mainly driven by wind conditions during migration at likely wintering or spring stopover areas to the west of Bracken Cave, while autumn migration timing was mainly affected by precipitation to east and north-east. Variation in summer population sizes at Bracken Cave was largely explained by fluctuations in maximum summer and autumn temperatures from the previous year in central and southern Mexico. Winter population estimates were positively associated with prior spring and summer maximum temperatures in states to the north of Texas. These results illustrate how some of the remaining knowledge gaps on the influence of climate change on bat migration and abundance can be addressed by analysing historical weather radar data.

#### Developing automatic radar-controlled wind turbine shutdown to reduce collision mortality of local breeding birds.

**Jonne Kleyheeg-Hartman**, H.A.M. Prinsen, A. Potiek

Along the western edge of the Rotterdam harbor on the Dutch west coast, a wind farm of 22 wind turbines is being developed. This onshore wind farm is neighboring the largest breeding colony in the world for Lesser Black-backed Gull (±19,000 breeding pairs). One of the mitigating measures that is being applied concerns wind turbine shutdown for locally breeding Lesser Black-backed Gulls and Herring Gulls, using a dedicated Max® 3D bird radar within the wind farm. Each individual wind turbine will be stopped for a maximum of 50 hours per year. Because of this upper limit in shutdown time, it is important to employ the available hours of shutdown at moments with the highest collision risk to achieve the largest possible reduction in collision mortality. This asks for a very precise definition of the decision rules for shutdown and will ask the utmost of the capabilities of the bird radar.

Automatic radar-controlled shutdown for locally breeding gulls is very innovative and requires an intensive developmental process. The goal is to automatically stop individual wind turbines when the radar detects high-risk flights of the target species. The challenge is to define a ruleset with which the radar can automatically identify these high-risk flights. This means that we will have to 1) define specific characteristics of radar tracks belonging to the target species, and 2) define risk-areas within which flights of gulls might lead to a collision. 

Bird radars are not (yet) able to automatically identify birds at species(group) level, so without further fine-tuning the wind turbines might end up being stopped for all kinds of larger bird species. The Max® 3D bird radar, however, records many track characteristics in high detail. In the breeding season of 2022, we start with site validation of radar tracks of gulls using visual observations and link information about species and bird numbers to radar tracks. With a large database of gull tracks we aim to identify characteristics of tracks of high-risk flights of the target gull species. These are used in the ruleset for shutdown. On our poster we will show the steps we take in the development of species- and turbine-specific radar-controlled shutdown.

This project offers a great opportunity to learn and develop state-of-the-art shutdown strategies that can significantly contribute to a wild-life friendly global energy transition.

#### CROW: Visualize bird migration in your browser

**[Peter Desmet](https://orcid.org// 0000-0002-8442-8025)**, Nicolas Noé, Robin Brabant, Maarten Reyniers

Every spring and autumn, millions of birds migrate over Europe. They mainly do this at high altitudes and at night, making this phenomenon largely invisible to us. But not for weather radars! We developed the open source web application "CROW" so you can explore these data directly in your browser. CROW pulls vertical profile data (vpts) from a public repository, calculates migration traffic rate (MTR), bird density and other variables, and visualizes these as interactive charts. The application can be hosted on a static file server and only visualizes data from one radar at a time, making it highly portable and scalable.

CROW was jointly developed by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI) in collaboration with the Royal Belgian Institute for Natural Sciences (RBINS), with financial support from the Belgian Science Policy Office (BelSPO valorisation project CROW). It is deployed at <https://www.meteo.be/birddetection> to show bird migration in real time across the Benelux. We are planning to deploy it for data in the ENRAM data repository (<https://enram.github.io/data-repository/>) as well.

#### Migratory behavior of the fall armyworm in Israel and its outbreak potential in Europe

**Fanqi Gao**, Yuval Werber, Nir Sapir, Regan Early, Jason Chapman

The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a major migratory noctuid moth originating in the Americas. The caterpillars of this pest can damage over 180 species of plants. The fall armyworm’s preferred host plant (corn) suffers tremendous damage and the yield can be reduced by up to 70%, potentially causing billions of dollars of economic loss. The fall armyworm has recently invaded almost every country in Africa and Asia, even as far as Australia. Although it has not yet reached Europe, it is already frequent throughout Israel. As Israel provides a natural link between Europe and Africa, there is concern that fall armyworms may soon reach southern Europe.  In order to monitor the population trends, migration routes and the likelihood of invading Europe, research in this region is urgently needed. My PhD project will make use of data from a vertical-looking BirdScan radar and trapping in the Hula Valley of North Israel, and will focus on predicting the migratory routes and outbreak potential of fall armyworm in Europe. In this presentation, I will introduce my project and the main objectives of our research, and share some preliminary results.
