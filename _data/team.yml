  description: >
    Animal migrations, especially their large scale patterns and timing are Silke’s core research 
    interest. Although much of her research has been devoted to migrants and migrations themselves, 
    it increasingly also recognizes that migrants can have a multitude of effects and interact with 
    the resident communities visited during their journeys. Silke is a senior researcher at the 
    [Swiss Ornithological institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/), GloBAM’s coordinator and 
    lead of its synthesis-parts.
